So long as CSS isn't a necessary aspect of existence, that is. Pictured above is the homepage at the time of writing this update. As you can see aesthetics come second to functionality in my playbook. Not that it matters; I've yet to tell anybody about this project, nor have I pushed it onto the [mycelialbackup.org](http://mycelialbackup.org) domain. So functionally the only way to view this page is through the github repo, and I certainly hope nobody's bored enough to be doing that.

That said, 24 hours ago this website was just an idea. Now it's an idea with some basic infrastructure behind it, and that seemed newsworthy enough. Not to mention it's difficult to program the news page if there's no news...
